Data science life cycle:

1.Hypothesis definition:- A proposed explanation as a starting point for further investigation.
    Ex:- A(company) wants to release a Raincoat(product) in Summer. now the company is in a dilemma whether to release the product or not. (i know its a bad idea, but for      understanding, let's think this.)
2. Data Acquisition:- collecting the required data.
    Ex:- collecting the last 10 years of data in a certain region.
3.Exploratory Data Analysis(EDA):- Analysing collected data using some concepts(will see them below).
    Ex: on collected data(existing data)data scientists will perform some analysis and decide, what are features/metrics to consider for model building.
4.Model building:- this is where Machine learning comes into light.
    Ex:- by using metrics(outputs of EDA), they will predict(using ML )whether the product will be successful or not if it goes into the market.
5.Result report:- after doing EDA and Model building, it generates results.
    Ex: as a result of all the above steps we get some results, which decides whether to start production or not.
6.final Product:- based on the result, we will get a product.
    Ex:- if the result generated is positive, A(company) can start production. if the result is negative, A won't start production.
