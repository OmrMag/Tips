<h2> Ten Good Coding Practices for Data Scientists </h2>

1. Use Descriptive Variable Names
2. Make good use of functions to organize code
3. Use pre-existing libraries whenever possible
4. Avoid long method chains (One operation per line if possible)
5. Avoid highly nuanced and complicated language constructs when simple ones will do the trick
6. Use an IDE like PyCharm or RStudio for production code… (Sorry Jupyter, I love you, but not for production)
7. Don’t forget to include doc strings and other language specific documentation
8. Write unit tests as you go
9. Adopt and adhere to a style standard like PEP8 or equivalent.
10. Learn to use and love loggers



<h2> Data science life cycle: </h2>

1. Hypothesis definition:- A proposed explanation as a starting point for further investigation.<br>
Ex:- A(company) wants to release a Raincoat(product) in Summer. now the company is in a dilemma whether to release the product or not. (i know its a bad idea, but for understanding, let's think this.)<br><br>
2. Data Acquisition:- collecting the required data.<br>
Ex:- collecting the last 10 years of data in a certain region.<br><br>
3. Exploratory Data Analysis(EDA):- Analysing collected data using some concepts(will see them below).<br>
Ex: on collected data(existing data)data scientists will perform some analysis and decide, what are features/metrics to consider for model building.<br><br>
4. Model building:- this is where Machine learning comes into light.<br>
Ex:- by using metrics(outputs of EDA), they will predict(using ML )whether the product will be successful or not if it goes into the market.<br><br>
5. Result report:- after doing EDA and Model building, it generates results.<br>
Ex: as a result of all the above steps we get some results, which decides whether to start production or not.<br><br>
6. final Product:- based on the result, we will get a product.<br>
Ex:- if the result generated is positive, A(company) can start production. if the result is negative, A won't start production.
